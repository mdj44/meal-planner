    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Wash and dry all produce.",
    "Add 10 cups hot water and 2 tsp salt to a large pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. While water comes to a boil, peel, then mince or grate the garlic.

Roast in the top of the oven, stirring halfway through cooking, 20-22 min.",
