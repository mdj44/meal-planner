# Store Maps

This directory contains store layout images used for mapping grocery items to physical store locations.

## Adding a Store Map

1. Save your store layout image (like the Walmart Mumford Road map) to this directory
2. Name it descriptively, e.g., `walmart-mumford.jpg`
3. The image will be overlaid with numbered dots corresponding to grocery list items

## Current Store Maps

- **walmart-mumford.jpg** - Walmart Mumford Road location layout
  - To use this map, copy the Walmart Mumford Road store layout image you provided into this directory as `walmart-mumford.jpg`
  
## Store Layout Configuration

Store layouts are configured in `/lib/store-layouts/` with coordinates mapping items to specific aisles and sections.

Current layouts:
- `walmart-mumford.ts` - Walmart Mumford Road layout with aisle-by-aisle mapping
